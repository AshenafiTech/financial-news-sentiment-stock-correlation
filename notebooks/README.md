- Analyze publisher distributions and extract domains
- Perform basic text analysis (keyword extraction, topic modeling)
- Identify missing values and outliers

**How to Run:**
1. Ensure all dependencies in [requirements.txt](../requirements.txt) are installed.
2. Place the required CSV files in the appropriate `data/` subdirectories.
3. Open `EDA.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code and run the cells sequentially.

**Outputs:**
- Summary tables and charts for data understanding
- Initial findings to inform further quantitative and sentiment analysis
